                            <p>The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is a luxury casino and hotel resort on the Las Vegas Strip,
                                consisting of two high rise towers both at 184 metres tall. Although built by

                                for US$1.73bn, less than half its original construction price of US$3.90bn. Despite its

                                location and gaming credentials, the resort is still considered something of a financial

                            <p>When it opened in 2007, the new 90,000 capacity Wembley had a lot to live up to.
                                Replacing
                                the stadium seen by many as the "home" of football, New Wembley was endowed with a
                                striking
                                134-metre-high arch as recompense for the iconic twin towers that were demolished
                                along with old Wembley.</p>

                            <p>The road to completion was paved with delays and complications including the collapse of
                                sewers
                                due to ground movement and the fall of a steel rafter from the roof. What’s more, the
                                Australian
                                contractor Multiplex made significant losses from the project, and is still involved in
                                legal
                                cases against sub-contractors and consultants.</p>

                            <p>Interestingly, the largest claim of £253million against Mott McDonald consultants is a UK
                                construction record.</p>

                            <p>In the end however, Wembley got the impressive stadium it deserved. While the England
                                national
                                side may have yet to repeat its success at the illustrious predecessor, we may safely
                                assume
                                that things can only get better.</p>

                            <p>Technically one of the oldest museums in China, this museum was originally located in the
                                city
                                of Kaifeng, and its establishment coincided with a political push towards culture and
                                education in the 1920s. In 1927, General Feng Yuxiang, who was the chairman of Henan
                                province
                                at the time, made the famous declaration: “education is the essential politics for a
                                country
                                (jiaoyu wei liguo genben yao zheng - ?????????)”, and thus the museum was set
                                up a month later. </p>

                            <p>In 1961, the museum was moved to a new site in Zhengzhou, where we now see its
                                distinctive
                                pyramid architecture. </p>

                            <p>Occupying an area of over 100,000 square meters, it is also one of the largest museums in
                                China. </p>

                            <p>One of the most well-known museums in the world, Le Louvre is a building with a long
                                history.</p>

                            <p>Originally a 12th century fortress built by Philip II, it was extended many times into
                                what
                                became the Louvre Palace. For several hundred years Le Louvre continued to be a palatial
                                home
                                for France’s royalty, until 1682, when Louis XIV choose to live at the Palace of
                                Versailles.</p>

                            <p>It was not until 10 August 1793, on the first anniversary of the fall of the French
                                monarchy,
                                that the building was opened as a museum to the public, the contents largely being
                                composed
                                of items from the former royal collection.</p>

                            <p>Nowadays, the museum is known for the glass pyramid that stands over the entrance
                                in the main court, which was completed in 1989.</p>

                            <p>One of the largest museums in the world, the State Hermitage is actually a museum complex
                                formed of six buildings, five of which are open to the public. The most iconic of these
                                is
                                the Winter Palace, the former residence of the Russian monarchy.</p>

                            <p>In 1837, much of the palace was destroyed by a fire that spread undetected through the
                                concealed and disused fireplaces of the building. As the Tsar had ordered the rebuilding
                                to be completed within a year, the fire was followed by a ruthless campaign of rapid
                                reconstruction, in which workers were said to have perished every day.</p>

                            <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art boasts a storied architectural history. Originally built
                                in a
                                High Victorian Gothic style with red-brick and stone, the museum was initially

                                Twenty years after its completion, the building was already being redesigned. This led
                                to
                                the now well-known Beaux-Arts facade on Fifth Avenue.</p>

                            <p> Designed by the German architect Jürgen Mayer-Hermann, who won a competition for ideas
                                to
                                redevelop the site, the Parasol overcame construction difficulties that saw it more than
                                double in cost to €100m after six years of work and a redesign.</p>

                            <p>The Metropol Parasol has revitalised the Plaza de la Encarnación, which was for years
                                reduced
                                to being used as a parking lot and gained a reputation as a dead zone between the city’s
                                popular tourist attractions.</p>

                            <p>The structure consists of six large mushroom-shaped parasols which provide shade from the
                                city’s often hot climate and stands some 90 feet high and nearly 500 feet long. To avoid
                                disturbing the Roman Ruins in the area, supporting columns could only be placed in
                                certain
                                locations, requiring an unusual design.</p>

                            <p>Visitors, who may be interested to know that the structure is held together by
                                (super-strong)

                                shops and an archaeological museum. The parasol is also used for public events.</p>
